# GHZ_numeric

**Green Hollands Zimmerman (GHZ) Transport Solver**

A modular C++ framework for solving the **GHZ transport equations** 
for an effective source on Kerr spacetime.  
The code is designed for studies of **nonlinear gravitational perturbations**,
**self-force**, and **QNM mode coupling** 
using the nonlinear Teukolsky formalism and implements the 
**Geroch‚ÄìHeld‚ÄìPenrose (GHP)**, and Held formalisms.

## üî≠ Overview

`GHZ_numeric` provides analytic and numerical infrastructure for:
- Constructing the **Kerr metric** and its coordinate representations (Boyer‚ÄìLindquist, ingoing, and outgoing Kerr coordinates).
- Defining **null tetrads** (Kinnersley, Carter, Hartle‚ÄìHawking) and transforming between them.
- Computing **spin coefficients** in both NP and **GHP-covariant** form.
- Representing and manipulating **GHP scalars** (with spin- and boost-weights).
- Setting up the **transport equations** along null congruences (for the GHZ system).
- (In future modules) Importing the effective source in $m$-modes
- (In future modules) Integrating the GHZ shadowless **transport equations** numerically spectral and 
finite difference methods
- (In future modules) Reconstructing the effective metric from Teukolsky data and the corrector.
in a asymptotically flat shadowless radiation gauge 
- 
  The architecture is designed to be modular and extendable, allowing both **analytic** and **numerical** workflows.

## üß± Project Structure


Each class is independent and documented internally.  
The `main.cpp` file demonstrates how to:
- Construct the Kerr metric.
- Build a tetrad.
- Compute NP and GHP spin coefficients.
- Verify metric‚Äìtetrad consistency.
